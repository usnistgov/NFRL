## Windows
Build output may be redirected to any convenient dir by utilizing the '-B' switch for the 'cmake' command.
For the Windows examples below, build output is redirected to RAMDRIVE (R:\).  A nice tool to create RAMDRIVE for
Windows is OFSMount (osforensics.com).

From the './build' subdir, open PowerShell terminal:

NFRL core:
cmake -S .. -B R:\NFRL_core -DCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="Release"
MSBuild.exe R:\NFRL_core\nfrl_core.sln

NFRL opencv:
cmake -S .. -B R:\NFRL_opencv -DCMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES="Release" -DUSE_OPENCV=1
MSBuild.exe R:\NFRL_opencv\nfrl_opencv.sln

Library files are located here on successful build:
./NFRL_core/src/lib/Release/nfrl_core.lib
./NFRL_opencv/src/lib/Release/nfrl_opencv.lib


## Linux
In a terminal, navigate to the './build' subdir:

NFRL core:
cmake ..
make

NFRL opencv:
cmake -DUSE_OPENCV=1 ..
make

Library files are located here on successful build:
./src/lib/libnfrl_opencv.a
./src/lib/libnfrl_core.a
